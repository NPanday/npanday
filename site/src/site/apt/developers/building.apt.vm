Building NPanday

  Building NPanday is quite simple and follows the typical convention for a Maven project.

* Pre-requisites

  Since NPanday is built using NPanday, you must fulfil all the prerequisites documented in the
  {{{../guide/installation/index.html} Installation Guide}}. NPanday trunk usually builds against one
  of the latest releases. If you want

  <<NPanday builds using .NET 2.0.>> So, if you do not have Visual Studio 2005 installed, you must install
  .NET SDK 2.0 or Windows SDK 6.1 (includes .NET SDK 2.0) manually. This is, because neither VS 2008 or VS 2010
  include the SDK for .NET 2.0. Find the download locations in the Installation Guide.

  NUnit-Binaries must be on the PATH environment variable.
  
* Checking out the Source Code

  You can check out the latest source code from {{https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/npanday/trunk}}. You can also
  download a previous version as an archive from the web site, or from check it out from the subdirectory of
  {{https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/npanday/tags}}.

  For example:

----
svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/npanday/trunk npanday
----

* Building All with Maven

  Everything in the distribution, including the Visual Studio add-in, is built using the following command:

----
mvn clean install
----

  <Note:> On Windows Vista and Windows 7, this presently needs to be run as an administrator to build successfully,
          as it installs 3 libraries into the GAC.

  Once this command has completed, you can proceed to use the Maven plugins immediately. To install the Visual Studio
  Add-in, you will need to still run the <<<mvn npanday.plugin:maven-vsinstaller-plugin:install>>> command as described
  in the {{{../guide/installation/index.html} Installation Guide}}.

* Building the Visual Studio Add-in with Visual Studio / MSBuild

  If you just wish to work on the Visual Studio Add-in, it can be loaded into Visual Studio and built there. More
  information is available in {{{./debugging-addin.html} Debugging the Visual Studio Add-in}}.

* Building All and executing the ITs

  You can also build the source code and execute the ITs. But first you have to install the ITs in your local repository using the following command:
  
----
mvn clean install
----

  After you have installed the ITs locally, you can now build the source code and execute the ITs by using the following command:
  
----
mvn clean install -PintegrationTests
----
  
* Running Integration Tests

  The Maven command line plugins feature a series of integration tests to ensure that everything is working as
  expected. They can be obtained by checking out the source code at
  {{https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/npanday/npanday-its/trunk}}.

  For example:

----
svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/npanday/npanday-its/trunk npanday-its
----

  From within that directory, you can run it against the latest available version of NPanday (likely the one you have
  just built above) using the following command:

----
mvn test -Prun-its
----

  The command will indicate which version of NPanday is being used, and which tests pass and fail. It will also
  indicate which version of .NET SDK is installed and used by the tests - for example, if .NET 3.5 SDK is not available,
  tests that depend on it will be skipped.

  You can also run them against a specific previous version of NPanday (which will be downloaded from the repository
  if needed):

----
mvn test -Prun-its -Dnpanday.version=${project.version}
----

  When contributing fixes for issues in the Maven plugins, it is appropriate to write an integration test along with it.
  They are written in Java, using JUnit, and contain a sample project against which <<<mvn>>> is run against, and the
  the expected results are then verified. Existing integration tests can be used as a guide.

* Cleaning the Environment

  It is common under the current architecture of NPanday to get clashes between versions, so if you are developing on a
  different version to the one previously run, you may wish to clean up your environment beforehand. The full steps to
  do so can be found in the {{{../guide/installation/uninstall.html} Uninstalling NPanday}} guide. You will need to
  rebuild NPanday with the steps above afterwards.

  <Note:> Not all steps are always required. The most common source of problems is the <<<uac>>> directory, and in
          particular the <<<rdfRepository>>> subdirectory, and the <<<npanday.artifacts.resolved>>> file. These can be
          safely deleted at any time without affecting the system as they will be regenerated.
