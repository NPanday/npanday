Pre-requisites

  Running NPanday's Maven plugins requires the following on your system:

    * Maven 2.0.9 or above (see {{{http://maven.apache.org/download.html} Maven's download page}} for instructions).

    * Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.6 or greater ({{{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html} Java SE Downloads}}). Also, the <<<JAVA_HOME>>> environment variable
      must be set to the directory where the JDK is installed, for example, <<<C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.6.0>>>.
      The <<<java>>> executable must also be available on your path.

    * Visual Studio 2005 (SP1) or the .NET 2.0 SDK for developing .NET 2.0 applications and libraries (.NET 2.0 SDK: {{{http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=fe6f2099-b7b4-4f47-a244-c96d69c35dec&displaylang=en} x86}}, {{{http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=1AEF6FCE-6E06-4B66-AFE4-9AAD3C835D3D} x64}})

    * Visual Studio 2008 (SP1) or the {{{http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=c17ba869-9671-4330-a63e-1fd44e0e2505&displaylang=en} Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET 3.5 SP1 }} for developing .NET 3.5 applications and
      libraries. Note: The SDK can be installed on XP or Vista, too.

    * Visual Studio 2010 (SP1) or the {{{ http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=6b6c21d2-2006-4afa-9702-529fa782d63b&displaylang=en} Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET 4 SP1 }} for developing .NET 4 applications and
      libraries. Note: The SDK can be installed on XP or Vista, too.

    * {{{http://www.nunit.org/?p=download} NUnit}} in order to run unit tests with NPanday. Make sure the <<<bin>>> directory is on the PATH.

  If you later have problems relating to being unable to find the SDK, refer to the
  {{{../reference/troubleshooting.html} Troubleshooting}} section. 

Removing a Previous Version

  While it is generally safe to install the new version without uninstalling the previous version, to ensure a clean
  system you may want to follow the {{{./uninstall.html} Uninstalling NPanday}} instructions.
  

Obtaining NPanday

  NPanday releases are made available in two locations:

    * {{{http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/npanday/} NPanday Download page}} - for downloading a full
      repository to install locally (once releases have been made from Apache)

    * {{{http://npanday.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx} Codeplex NPanday Download page}} - for downloading a full
      repository to install locally (releases before entering the Apache Incubator)

    * {{{http://repo.npanday.org/archiva/repository/npanday-group} NPanday Release and Dependencies Repository Group}} - for downloading directly from Maven.

      * Alternatively, you can use the pure {{{http://repo.npanday.org/archiva/repository/npanday-releases} NPanday Release Repository}}. You will also need to include the repository {{http://repository.aduna-software.org/maven2}} for some dependencies.

  In NPanday 1.1, the release is only made available as a Maven binary repository, or a source distribution.
  For information on how to build the project from source, see {{{../../developers/building.html} Building from Source}}
  in the Developer's Guide. NPanday 1.2 and above include a Windows installer as an option.

  ~~TODO: additional guides for using the existing repositories

Installing Using the Downloaded Binary Repository

  In this guide, we will use the repository downloaded from the NPanday download page.

* Installing NPanday's Maven Plugins

  Whether you are using just the Visual Studio integration or the full set of capabilities, you must have the Maven
  environment installed.

  For the purposes of this guide, we will copy the artifacts to our local environment only - however in most developer
  groups you will host the repository on a shared server that all developers can use to obtain the correct release.

  After downloading the binary repository, unpack the contents (you may need a 3rd party application to expand the
  <<<tar.gz>>> format on Windows). Next, copy the contents of <<<repository/releases>>> from the archive to
  <<<%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\\.m2\\repository>>>. This is the default <local repository> of a Maven installation if it
  has not been modified in Maven's <<<settings.xml>>>.

  For example, you may end up with a structure containing
  <<<C:\\Documents and Settings\\User\\.m2\\repository\\npanday\\apache-npanday\\\\${project.version}\\apache-npanday-${project.version}.pom>>>.

  To confirm your installation, run the following command, replacing <<<${project.version}>>> with the version you are installing:

----
mvn help:describe -DgroupId=org.apache.npanday.plugins -DartifactId=maven-vsinstaller-plugin -Dversion=${project.version}
----

  If successful, you should receive the following output:

----
Name: NPanday :: Visual Studio Addin Installer Maven Plugin
Description: Maven Plugin for .NET: Installs the Visual Studio Addin
Group Id: org.apache.npanday.plugins
Artifact Id: maven-vsinstaller-plugin
Version: ${project.version}
Goal Prefix: vsinstaller

This plugin has 1 goal:

vsinstaller:install
  Description: Installs Visual Studio 2005 addin.
----

  ~~TODO: add a troubleshooting guide and reference here in case it all goes wrong

  If you don't intend to use the Visual Studio Add-in, you can now {{{../advanced/index.html} get started using NPanday's Maven extensions}}.
  
* Installing the Visual Studio Add-in

  To install the Add-in, first ensure that Visual Studio is not running.

  Next, from a command prompt with the path set as indicated above, run the following command.  This command will generate the addin and copies the necessary libraries needed to 
  run the addin to a default location <<C:\\[PROGRAMFILES]\\NPanday>>>.

----
mvn org.apache.npanday.plugins:maven-vsinstaller-plugin:[version]:install
----
 
  You can also specify the location where you want the libraries to be copied by running the following command:
  
----
mvn org.apache.npanday.plugins:maven-vsinstaller-plugin:[version]:install -DinstallationLocation=url
----

  <<Note:>> On Windows Vista, Windows 7 and above, you will need to run the command as an administrator. This can be
            done by starting the command prompt using the <Run as administrator> option.

  After running the <<<maven-vsinstaller-plugin>>> the add-in will be located here:
  <<<C:\\Documents and Settings\\[user_home]\\My Documents\\Visual Studio 2005\\Addins\\NPanday.VisualStudio.AddIn>>>
  (or equivalent for Visual Studio 2008 or Visual Studio 2010).

  More information on how to verify the Add-in installation are located at the end of this guide.

Installing the Visual Studio Add-in using the NPanday Installer

  NPanday Installer allows user to use NPanday automatically without the hassle of downloading the repository and running commands to install it.  It will  
  generate the repository and the add-ins for both VS2005 and VS2008.

  To launch the NPanday Setup, click the installer twice,
 
[../../images/vs/installer/screen1.jpg]  
 
  After clicking the 'Next' button, End-User License Agreement wizard page will prompt.  Check the box and click the 'Next' button.
  
[../../images/vs/installer/screen2.jpg] 
  
  Next wizard page will be for the Custom Setup which will allow user to change the way the features will be installed and the location of the repository.

  If you are going to configure Maven to use NPanday installed on a remote repository, you can disable the installation of its artifacts in your local repository.

  An item for the Visual Studio Addin should appear for each version of Visual Studio that you have installed. You can then select which of these you wish for the Addin to be installed into.
  
[../../images/vs/installer/screen3.jpg]
   
  After changes were made, click on Next button and user will be redirected to the Installation wizard page.  Click on the 'Install' button to start installation.
  
[../../images/vs/installer/screen4.jpg]
   
  If installation was successful, user will be prompted with this:
  
[../../images/vs/installer/screen5.jpg]
 
  After running the installer the add-in will be located here:
  <<<C:\\Documents and Settings\\[user_home]\\My Documents\\Visual Studio 2005\\Addins\\NPanday.VisualStudio.AddIn>>>
  (or equivalent for Visual Studio 2008 or equivalent for Visual Studio 2010).

  You can verify that the Maven plugins are also installed correctly by following the same steps as shown in the previous section.
  
Verifying the NPanday Add-in

  To verify that the NPanday .NET Build Tool has been configured inside Visual Studio, perform the following instructions:

  [[1]] Launch Visual Studio (either from the command line or from the Windows Start> menu).

  [[2]] From inside Visual Studio, select Tools>NPanday Build System. This automatically starts NPanday and displays a
        confirmation in the Visual Studio Output window at the bottom of the Visual Studio screen.

  []

[../../images/vs/installer/verify_installation.jpg] NPanday Build System

  You can also set Visual Studio to automatically start NPanday Build System upon startup by checking
  NPanday.VisualStudio.Addin in Tools > Add-in Manager.

  After it starts, you will not see NPanday Build System listed in the Tools menu, until the next time you start Visual
  Studio.

* Getting Started with the Visual Studio Add-in

  You can now start Visual Studio and test the Add-in. The next section of this guide will focus on
  {{{../vs/index.html} using the Visual Studio Add-in}}.
